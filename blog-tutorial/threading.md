 
# Part 3: Threading Javascript

**RESOLVE TODOs!**

Javascript does not have threading built into it. Everything is 
executed sequential using callbacks to continue computations at some
later point.

Sunroof abstracts from this paradigm to enable its users 
to use Haskell style concurrency patterns when writing Javascript.

**TODO:** Write more than a stub.
