There have been several attempts to translate Haskell to JavaScript.
Prominent ones are the compiler backends for 
UHC \cite{Stutterheim:12:ImprovingUHCJavaScriptBackend} and 
GHCJS \cite{project:ghcjs}. There are also projects like Fay \cite{project:fay} 
that compile subsets of Haskell to JavaScript or JMacro \cite{project:jmacro}
which use quasiquotation \cite{Mainland:07:QuasiquotingHaskell} to embed 
a custom tailored language into Haskell code.

At the same time there are also project, like 
CoffeeScript \cite{project:coffeescript} or LiveScript \cite{project:livescript},
to build custom languages 
that are very similar to JavaScript, but add convenient syntax and
support for missing features.

Our approach to cooperative concurrency through continuations in JavaScript has
has been used before 
\cite{Cooper:07:LinksWebProgrammingTiers,Predescu:02:CocoonContinuationBasedControlFlow}.
To our knowledge the attempt to create a direct connection
between Haskell and JavaScript continuations has not been 
attempted before.

Deep embeddings of monads based on data structures have been used before
in Unimo \cite{Lin:06:Unimo} and Operational \cite{Apfelmus:10:Operational,Hackage:10:Operational}. 
The specific approach Sunroof takes 
by using GADTs has been discussed by Sculthrope in detail 
\cite{Sculthorpe:13:ConstrainedMonads}.

The Sunroof server does not have the aim to provide a full featured 
web framework, like HAppS, Snap or Yesod do.
