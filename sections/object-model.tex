\label{sec:object-model}

JavaScript is object based. It provides various objects,
including numbers, booleans, maps, and others. We
provide in Sunroof about a dozen common object,
including \Src{JSObject} (the generic object type), \Src{JSNumber}
(floating point numbers), \Src{JSCanvas} (HTML5 canvas type) 
and others. A simple
casting function is provided when the type-system
needs to be overwritten. Along with each of these types,
we provide typed methods.
\begin{verbatim}
 jsDrawBox :: JSObject -> JS t ()
 jsDrawBox document = do
     foo <- document # getElementById("foo")
     cxt <- foo # getContext("2d")     cxt # drawRect (0,0,100,100)
\end{verbatim}
Here, \Src{\#} is a reverse apply, so the types
of the function in the above example are
\begin{verbatim}
(#) :: o -> (o -> JS t a) -> JS t a
getElementById :: JSString -> JSObject -> JS t JSContext
getContext :: JSString -> JSContext -> JS t JSCanvas
drawRect :: (JSNumber,JSNumber,JSNumber,JSNumber) -> JSCanvas -> JS t ()
\end{verbatim}        
From experience, even though we are targeting
an untyped language, the type system gets in the
way less than we expected.

\subsubsection{RESOURCES - REMOVE WHEN FINISHED}

\begin{itemize}
\item We want to use Haskell's type system to give use type safety in JavaScript/Sunroof.
\item JavaScript is untyped / dynamically typed (???)
\item We can not represent all types in JavaScript
\item We have to give a way to add types later on
\item Use approach from \cite{Svenningsson:12:CombiningEmbedding}
\item There is a core expression language that is used to describe how and expression is built
\item We wrap that core type into wrappers
\item Introduce \Src{Sunroof} to mark wrappers
\item Wrappers have specific functionality for certain type
\item Wrappers can have phantom type to give more type safety
\item Example \Src{JSString} and \Src{JSArray a}
\item Unavoidable need to cast types some times: \Src{cast}
\item Adding a new type can be done mechanically: Template Haskell
\item Design decision: We do not want to introduce internal
structure for types. (Tuples aren't JS types)
\item \Src{JSTuple} exists to introduce types with custom structure
\item Introduce \Src{JSTuple}
\item manages composition and decomposition of custom types.
\item Meant to codify immutable records in JavaScript
\item They can only be changed
by decomposing them into Haskell and recreating a new structure
with other values.
\item Useful to manage more complex data structures in JavaScript.
\item Decomposition is pure operation: \Src{match}
\item Justification lies in the fact that they are meant to be 
immutable. Although there are possibilities to break this.
\item Composition is monadic effect: \Src{tuple}
\item It captures observable allocation and ensures that a reference to the
allocated value is created and used afterwards.
\item If it was not monadic the let binding would be like a macro
that reallocated the same object at each point. This 
is not desired behavior in most use-cases
\end{itemize}
