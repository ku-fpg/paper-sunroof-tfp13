As an example we developed is a small calculator. It uses Sunroof to
render its interface in the browser (Figure \ref{fig:example-application}). The 
Haskell server processes the arithmetic expressions by parsing them
into an AST and calculating the result of the expression.
The result is then sent back to the interface and displayed,
using Sunroof-generated JavaScript, 
utilizing the browsers rendering capabilities.
