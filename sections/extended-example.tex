\label{sec:extended-example}

To see how Sunroof works in practice we will now look into a small calculator
for arithmetic expressions. We use Sunroof to display our interface
and the results of our computation. Haskell will be used to parse the 
arithmetic expressions and calculate the result. The Sunroof server 
will be used to implement this JavaScript/Haskell hybrid.

Figure \ref{fig:example-application} shows the interface of our 
calculator. We not only display the result value, we also render 
the tree parsed from the arithmetic expression in Haskell.
