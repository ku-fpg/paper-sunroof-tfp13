 
Sunroof is a Haskell-hosted Domain Specific Language (DSL) for generating JavaScript.
Sunroof is build on top of the JavaScript monad, which, like the Haskell \IO-monad, allows 
access to external resources, but specifically JavaScript
resources. As such, Sunroof is primarily a feature-rich 
foreign-function API to the browser's JavaScript engine, and all the browser-specific
functionality, including HTML-based rendering, event handling, and 
drawing to the HTML5 canvas. 

In this paper, we give the design and implementation of Sunroof.
Using monadic reification, we generate JavaScript from
the a deep embedding of the JavaScript monad.
The Sunroof DSL has the feel of native Haskell, with a simple
Haskell-based type schema to guide the Sunroof programmer.
Furthermore, because we are generating code,
we can offer Haskell-style concurrency patterns, such as MVars and Channels.
In combination with a web-services package such as Scotty,
the Sunroof compiler offers a robust platform to build interactive web applications,
giving the ability to interleave Haskell and JavaScript computations
with each other as needed.
