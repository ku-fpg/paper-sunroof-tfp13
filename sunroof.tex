\section{Introduction}

We want to use the JavaScript API. Fast interpreters,
running in a browser advantage, 

We do not want to program in Javascript.

Example: hp2ps?

\section{Background}

Choices when compiling to Javascript
 * Port a compiler to JavaScript - issues, mismatching API
 * Provide an FFI - back and forward cost.
 * Compile a custom, cut down FP language. - example
 * DSL, restrictive, syntactically, how do we handle binding?

We use monad reification.
 * binding in Haskell becomes binding in reified language.
 * Feels like a native monad, cf STM.
 * Can build abstractions on top of this.

PUSH: how like a native Haskell monad can we make the JS monad feel?

PUSH: isomorphism between 
 
   a -> JS b  

and

   JSFunction a b
 
Compiling
 * If we transliterate, we have straight line code, can not pause.
    (Wait for Mvar, for example)
 * If we CPS translate, we can use continuations to capture the
   notion of a paused thread. Works well.
   Problems:
     * Can not translate functions, how do they get there return value
     * (Assumes straight line code.)
     * Also, the code becomes unreadable to anyone except a die-hard 
       compiler freak.
 
Choice:
 * We support both!
 * Phantom argument to JS
 * A = Atomic, B = Blockable.
